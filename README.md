# Code Editor Screen Recording with Camera

This project was developed using the React library. It allows you to write simple Html, Css and Javascript codes and see the preview of the written code. You can also turn on your camera and show yourself on the screen. Finally, there is a mechanic that allows you to record the screen as a video. You can download your recording if you wish.
